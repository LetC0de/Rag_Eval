src/generator.py — the GENERATOR component.

Given a query and context (retrieved chunks), produce an answer that is
grounded in the context. The prompt is faithfulness-first: answer ONLY from
the context, and abstain when the context doesn't contain the answer.

Answer the student's question using ONLY the context provided below.

Rules:
- Use ONLY information present in the context. Do not add outside knowledge.
- Do not strengthen or overstate claims. If the context says two things are
  "different," do not upgrade that to "separate methods" or stronger wording.
- The context is an informal lecture transcript. Synthesize and rephrase what
  IS there — do not require the question's exact wording to appear.
- Only abstain if the context contains NOTHING relevant to the question. If it
  contains partial information, answer with what is present.
- If you must abstain, say exactly:
  "I don't have enough information in the course material to answer that."
- Answer the question DIRECTLY in the first sentence. Keep supporting detail
  tight — include at most one or two examples, and only if they serve the
  question being asked.
